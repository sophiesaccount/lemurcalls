    "Consistently detecting, segmenting, and classifying animal vocalizations is crucial for the study and conservation of wildlife. Manual annotation, however, is time-consuming and labor-intensive, highlighting the need for reliable automated approaches. Deep learning methods—especially those leveraging transfer learning—have achieved promising results in Sound Event Detection in recent years. Yet, performance often declines when models are applied to small datasets with diverse and high background noise, as is typical for primate vocalizations. "
